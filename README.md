Application of statistical methods to business data:

1) Microsoft Stock Price Prediction (MS_stock):
The 2020 stock price data of Microsoft has been used to predict the probability of gain/drop for interested investors. 

Key tools: Statistical Modeling, normal distribution, KDE (PDF) plots 
Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy.stats

2) Statistical analysis of insurance data (Insurance):
The potential relationship between being a smoker and sex has been investigated for an insurance company called MedicaInsure using
relevant statistical tests.

Key tools: Hypothesis Testing, Statistical Inference, Chi-square test of independence, z-test for proportions
Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy.stats, statsmodels.stats

3) Analysis of a political survey (NEP):
The connection between the work experience and voting record of teachers on one hand, and their support of a new educational policy
drafted by the ruling party on the other hand has been studied using hypothesis testing.

Key tools: Hypothesis Testing, Statistical Inference, Chi-square test of independence, t-test for two samples
Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy.stats

4) Statistical analysis of an upgraded electronic news portal (ENews_Express):
Common statistical tests have been leveraged to compare the performance of the new design of an e-news portal, using a survey of 100
vistors, equally divided between the new and old websites, to answer questtions such as whether the time spent on the website and
conversion (subscription) rate have increased by the new design or not, and if these fibdings vary with the preferred language of the
user or not.

Key tools: Hypothesis Testing, a/b Testing, Statistical Inference, t-test, Chi-square test of independence, ANOVA test 
Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy.stats, statsmodels.stats
