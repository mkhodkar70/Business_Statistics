# Business_Statistics
Application of statistical methods to business data:

1) Microsoft stock price prediction (MS_stock): <br> 
The 2020 stock price data of Microsoft has been used to predict the probability of gain/drop for interested investors. <br>                                  Key tools: Statistical Modeling, normal distribution, KDE (PDF) plots <br> 
Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy.stats

2) Statistical analysis of insurance data (Insurance): <br> 
The potential relationship between being a smoker and sex has been investigated for the customers of an insurance provider,
called MedicaInsure, using relevant statistical tests. <br> 
Key tools: Hypothesis Testing, Statistical Inference, Chi-square test of independence, z-test for proportions <br> 
Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy.stats, statsmodels.stats

3) Analysis of a political survey (NEP): <br> 
The connection between the work experience and voting record of teachers on one hand, and their support of a new educational policy
drafted by the ruling party on the other hand has been studied using hypothesis testing. <br> 
Key tools: Hypothesis Testing, Statistical Inference, Chi-square test of independence, t-test for two samples <br> 
Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy.stats

4) Statistical analysis of an upgraded electronic news portal (ENews_Express): <br> 
Common statistical tests have been leveraged to compare the performance of the new and old designs of an e-news portal, using a survey
of 100 vistors, equally divided between the two, to answer questions such as whether the time spent on the website and conversion
(subscription) rate have been increased by the new website or not, and if these findings vary with the preferred language of the
user or not. 
Key tools: Hypothesis Testing, a/b Testing, Statistical Inference, t-test, Chi-square test of independence, ANOVA test <br>  
Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy.stats, statsmodels.stats
